Recipe for Maggi
Indian Tadka Maggi

Indian Tadka Maggi is the cooler cousin of your mom's pulao. All you need is: one finely chopped onion and tomato, one chopped green chilli, ½ tsp of coriander powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, mustard seeds and salt to taste.

How to make Indian Tadka Maggi

Boil the Maggi cake in a vessel and drain the water. Heat a pan and sauté the chopped onions in it till they are golden brown and tomatoes are soft. Add the masalas (+ the Maggi masala tastemaker) and cook for a minute.

Add the boiled noodles to the pan and stir well. Voila, Indian Tadka Maggi is ready. Pro tip: Garnish it with coriander leaves and fried onions to outdo the pulao.
